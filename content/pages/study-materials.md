Quiz: A Priori, Necessary, Analytic
-----------------------------------

This quiz is to test your knowledge of, and examine your intuitions about, three distinctions that are important to Kant's philosophy, and indeed to philosophy more widely (see Lecture 1). For each sentence, write T beside it if it is true, F if false. Then, for the true ones, circle one from each of the pairs beneath the sentence.
